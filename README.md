Memory based game with fully functioning and cutomizable GUI
I developed this game in order to improve motor and cognitive functions within the minds of the individuals that play it.
The app was made fully in python using tkinter as its main library, this is one of my favorite projects because of how visual it is.
I hope you like this project and I hope to upload more apps that implement GUIs just like this one.
